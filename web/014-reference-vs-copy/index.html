    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // now here is the problem!
    console.log(players, team);

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // and think we make a copy:

    console.log('Person:', person);
    console.log('Captain:', captain);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 });
    console.log('Captain2:', captain2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
